BF006 smoke tests and BF007 manual acceptance/regression checks passed at their closure. BF014.1 verification also passed the existing standalone regression scripts and real MariaDB acceptance; no unified project-wide test runner exists.

## Current Planning State

BF013, BF014, BF015, AF001–AF003, and AF004 — Property Administration UI — are **IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED / CLOSED**. AF004.1 through AF004.6 are closed.

The closed BF014 contract records schema/integrity, repositories/read models, services, authorization/HTTP, seed runner/baseline, dynamic form projection, MariaDB acceptance/regressions, and documentation closure. BF015 records the bounded Property Profile persistence bridge.

## Approved Future Execution Order

AF004 is closed. BF016 is IN PROGRESS / OPEN; BF016.2 and BF016.3 are IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED. BF016.4–BF016.6 remain pending; no next internal unit is selected by this handoff. AF004 remains limited to administrative composition of BF013/BF014/BF015; completeness, media/private-document persistence, Listing, Marketplace, Requests, Deals, Commissions, and transfers remain deferred.

1. Architecture closure - complete
2. BF014 parent sprint contract - recorded and authoritative
3. BF014 - Canonical Property Catalog Foundation - IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED / CLOSED
4. BF015 - Property Profile Persistence Bridge - IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED / CLOSED
5. Rich Property Profile beyond the bridge
6. System Admin Property Data Management frontend
7. Initial canonical data verification and approved business additions
8. Admin Properties frontend: Active, Drafts, Add Unit, and Property Details
9. Listing implementation
10. Requests, Deals, Commissions, Notifications, and Reports

## Constraints for Future Planning

- Preserve the BF006-BF007 staged `organizations` schema unless an approved milestone changes it.
- Resolve the documented no-hard-delete versus Organization physical DELETE discrepancy before
  relying on deletion behavior for future business modules.
- Franchise DELETE is scoped to status-based archival (`inactive`); it does not create a general lifecycle framework.
- Authentication and authorization are implemented through BF010-BF012 and remain backend-authoritative.
- Preserve the approved System Organization -> Franchise -> Partner Agency hierarchy. Users belong to an
  Organization in this hierarchy; do not treat Users as another hierarchy level.
- Preserve the approved distinction between future Global Marketplace Visibility and Administrative
  Scope. Do not use Organization management scope to isolate marketplace-eligible available Listings.
- Use `docs/architecture/LISTING_DOMAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md` as the canonical source for approved Listing boundaries and behavior.
- Use `docs/architecture/LISTING_PHYSICAL_DATA_MODEL.md` as the canonical source for the approved conceptual physical model; do not treat it as a committed SQL schema.
- Use `docs/architecture/PROPERTY_PROFILE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for approved Rich Property Profile behavior and `docs/architecture/PROPERTY_CATALOG_ARCHITECTURE.md` for approved Catalog/Data Governance behavior; Rich Property Profile remains unimplemented, while Property Catalog is partially implemented through BF014.1 schema and BF014.2 repositories/read models.
- Use `docs/database/SEED_DATA.md` as the approved seed strategy. Schema migrations and seed execution remain separate, and no Property catalog seed scripts currently exist.
- Use `docs/sprints/BF013-property-ownership-foundation.md` as the authoritative closed BF013 implementation contract.
- Keep future Listing SQL schema, APIs, Listing Permission codes, Team scope, complete Request/Deal/Commission/Transfer workflows, publication field lists, and subsequent sprint scope deferred until separately approved.
- Do not infer implementation from broader planned architecture documents.
- Preserve Organization Property versus Listing separation, Organization-private Owner/Ownership/Proposal data, backend-authoritative completeness, and the Arabic-first/RTL-first frontend direction.

## BF016 — Organization and Property Setup Data Foundation

**BF016.2 — Franchise Basic Profile Implementation and BF016.3 — Property Administrative Details: IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**, recorded 2026-10-05. The BF016 parent is **IN PROGRESS / OPEN** until BF016.4–BF016.6 are completed. No next internal unit is selected by this handoff. BF013, BF014, BF015 and AF004 remain closed.

Focused real-MariaDB acceptance and Operational Franchise Admin Activation passed. All 51 required BF016/BF013/BF014/BF015 test/regression entry points passed, including integrated suites and additional service/concurrency tests; all 147 process cleanup checks passed. PHP syntax and frontend typecheck, lint and build passed. No real development database schema/data was modified.

Organization logo/media, persisted Property images, documents/contracts, galleries/videos, Listing, Marketplace, Requests, Deals, Commissions, completeness and Listing Ready remain deferred. Property setup is not Listing readiness.

Migration synchronization is planned only for `directors_resale_platform` on `127.0.0.1:3306`: migrations 034 then 035 only, in repository order, no canonical seed impact, verified backup and explicit user approval required, all test/acceptance/demo/fixture data excluded, and preflight/post-apply checks required. Migrations 034 and 035 remain unapplied to the real database; no synchronization was executed.

The 14 mojibake sequences are pre-existing in two BF014 fixtures (eight in `BF014RepositoryDatabaseAcceptanceTest.php`, six in `BF014SchemaAcceptanceTest.php`), match `HEAD`, and were not changed by this work. No invalid UTF-8, replacement characters or new mojibake were introduced.

Canonical implementation evidence and synchronization preflight/backup/post-apply requirements: [BF016 implementation record](../sprints/BF016-organization-and-property-setup-data-foundation.md). Documentation and handoff remain uncommitted; no commit or push was performed.

### BF016.2/BF016.3 final review evidence — 2026-10-05

Company profile now supports existing Organization name, System Franchise selection, private own-Franchise editing, optional street address and protected five-level canonical geography with legitimate skips, safe empty reads and ancestry hydration. Property Data/review now expose an immutable persisted `PROP-<ULID>` code, canonical address, optional positive DECIMAL(18,4) asking price with explicit EGP/USD/SAR/AED currency, and a labelled generic image placeholder without storage. Existing BF015 typed-value patches, atomic revisions and explicit conflict retry are preserved. Authorization remains backend-owned; no permission codes or Listing side effects were added.

Verification: 51/51 PHP matrix entry points passed (two focused BF016 acceptances, Operational Franchise Admin Activation, three BF013, 28 BF014 entry/integrated suites, 12 additional BF014 service/concurrency tests, five BF015). All 147 process cleanup checks passed. PHP syntax passed for 190 files. Frontend typecheck, lint, the BF016 canonical-geography/empty-profile/hydration/error contract acceptance and production build passed. The build completed final trace collection in an identical isolated source copy with shared installed dependencies because the running development server held the original `.next` trace; the development server was left running. Strict UTF-8 and diff checks passed. The 14 pre-existing mojibake sequences in the two BF014 fixtures match HEAD and were not changed; no new mojibake or replacement characters were introduced.

MariaDB remained available at 127.0.0.1:3306; configuration targeted exactly directors_resale_platform. Read-only before/after schema, row-count and data fingerprints matched for all 30 real tables. All newly created disposable databases were removed; the pre-existing directors_resale_platform_e1_test_9740 remained untouched. Repository migrations 001–035 are verified by exact ordered filename equality. Migrations 034 and 035 remain unapplied to the real database. Future synchronization requires a reviewed preflight, verified backup, explicit user approval, 034 then 035 only, no canonical seed impact, exclusion of all test/acceptance/demo/fixture data, and post-apply schema/index/constraint, application and unchanged-business-data checks. No real schema/data operation was performed.

BF016.2 and BF016.3 are IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED / READY for review on codex-review. BF016 parent remains OPEN; BF016.4–BF016.6 remain OPEN / PENDING and no next unit is selected. Full media/logo/image persistence, galleries/videos, private documents/contracts, Listing, Marketplace, Requests, Deals, Commissions, completeness and Listing Ready remain deferred. Official-branch merge remains controlled by the human owner.
