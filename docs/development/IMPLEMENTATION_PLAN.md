# Implementation Plan - Current Status

## Completed

| Milestone | Status | Verified State |
|---|---|---|
| BF001 | Completed | Backend bootstrap, container, router, response, exception handling, health endpoint |
| BF002 / BF002.1 / BF002.2 | Completed | Contracts and reusable database foundation |
| BF003 | Completed | Generic BaseRepository |
| BF004 | Completed | Service-container functionality present; no separate Git commit |
| BF005 | Completed | HTTP Kernel and Request abstraction |
| BF006 | Completed | Organization CRUD/API, staged `organizations` table, and routing fix `a017c94` |
| BF007 | Completed | Organization-backed Franchise CRUD/API, `parent_organization_id`, System-parent validation, and status-based archival |
| BF008 | Implemented | Organization-backed Partner Agency CRUD/API, Franchise-parent validation, isolation, and status-based archival |

BF006 smoke tests and BF007 manual acceptance/regression checks passed. No automated test suite exists.

## Next Development Target

No next milestone is selected. BF009 remains subject to a separate project decision.

## Constraints for Future Planning

- Preserve the BF006-BF007 staged `organizations` schema unless an approved milestone changes it.
- Resolve the documented no-hard-delete versus Organization physical DELETE discrepancy before
  relying on deletion behavior for future business modules.
- Franchise DELETE is scoped to status-based archival (`inactive`); it does not create a general lifecycle framework.
- Authentication and authorization remain future integration dependencies and are not implemented by BF008.
- Continue the approved Organization -> Franchise -> Partner Agency -> Users hierarchy; do not introduce
  another parent model or hierarchy level.
- Do not infer implementation from broader planned architecture documents.
